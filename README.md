Group Project
Note from Group Leader, Sanya Safi:
Towards the end of the project, we noticed that something had happened during my merges that deleted some of the css code of the othe group memebers. At that point we had thought it was done until we did a final run through. Because of this, two of the group members were not able to get to their computers, as they were busy. I and and another group memeber were able to fix the mistakes and commiting those to the repoistory. Those should not be counted in our # of commits or lines.

    This issue with the accidental deletion of code was on my (Sanya Safi's) end, and the others were great team players that helped figure out what to do and add the things back into the code.
